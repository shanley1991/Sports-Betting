This is the third shiny application.  This app creates a bar chart comparing the 
predicted spread to the vegas spread.  There is an object to filter the chart
on a specific game.  The predicted spread is for the home team.  The negative predicted
spreads mean the home team is losing by that amount.  The negative vegas spreads would
need to go a step further to align with the moneyline odds.  Comparing the vegas
spread with the vegas moneylines will tell you which team was favored in the spread.
