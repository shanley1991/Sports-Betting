Introduction

The main goal of my project is to simulate NFL regular season games and use that to generate predictions.  
These probabilities can be converted to predicted moneyline and spreads for the games.  
Just for clarification, the moneyline refers to picking who will win the game with 
the associated odds.  The spread is predicting by much a team needs to at least win
or lose by in a certain game.  The use of these predicted moneylines and spreads
can be compared to the current vegas odds to determine if there is an edge.  
Moreover, if your predicted spread or moneyline is different than vegas that may
indicate that game being worth a wager.  Of course this is only one piece of
determining which games to wager on but can be useful.
